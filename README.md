### Analysing the data of users who shorten links ending with .gov or .mil.
---

In this data analysis project, I drew inspiration in chapter 14 of the Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython book.

`Data sources`

In 2011, URL shortening service Bitly partnered with the US government website USA.gov to provide a feed of anonymous data gathered from users who shorten links ending with .gov or .mil. This is one of the preserved text files from that activity.

The file contains web data (JSON).
